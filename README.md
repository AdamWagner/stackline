## What is stackline & why would I want to use it?

`stackline` adds simple, unobtrusive visual indicators to compliment `yabai`'s window stacking functionality.

A 'stack' is a generalized subset of a tabbed UI that enables multiple macOS windows to occupy the same screen space and behave as a single unit. A stack let's a user…

- add & remove windows from a stack
- navigate between stacked windows
- _understand the contents of a stack at a glance_


Stacks are a recent addition (June 2020) to the (_excellent!_) macOS tiling window manager [koekeishiya/yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai). See [yabai #203](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/203) for more info about `yabai`'s stacking feature. Currently, `yabai` does not provide visual indication of a stack's active window or the inactive windows below. This makes it easy to forgot about the stacked windows that aren't visible.

Enter `stackline`: simple, unobtrusive visual indicators that compliment `yabai` window stacks.


![stackline-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1683979/90967233-08f6bc00-e491-11ea-9b0a-d75f248ce4b1.gif)

### Features

- 🚦 **See your stacks**. Window indicators show you which BSP leaves are stacks & how many windows each stack contains
- 🔦 **App icons**. Toggle icons on to know exactly which apps are stacked where. Toggle icons off and get a slim minimalistic indicator that doesn't get in the way.
- 🧘‍♂️️ **Smart positioning**. Whichever mode you prefer, indicators always stay out of the way on the outside edge of the window (nearest the screen edge). `stackline v0.1.55` has full support for multi-monitor setups, too.
- 🧮 **Always in sync**. stackline keeps track of stacks as you move between spaces, resize windows, and add or remove stacks.
- 🕹️ **Flexible control**. Control stackline via shell commands, or access the instance directly via Hammerspoon.

## Getting started with stackline

### Prerequisites

- https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai ([install guide](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai-(latest-release)))
- https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon ([getting started guide](https://www.hammerspoon.org/go/))
- https://github.com/stedolan/jq (`brew install jq`)

See [wiki](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/wiki/Install-&-configure-dependencies#user-content-configure-yabai-stacks) for example keybindings to create and navigate between stacks.

### Installing stackline

1. [Clone the repo into ~/.hammerspoon/stackline](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/wiki/Install-stackline#1-clone-the-repo-into-hammerspoonstackline)
2. [Install the hammerspoon cli tool](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/wiki/Install-stackline#2-install-the-hammerspoon-cli-tool)

#### 1. Clone the repo into ~/.hammerspoon/stackline

```sh
# Get the repo
git clone https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline.git ~/.hammerspoon/stackline

# Make stackline run when hammerspoon launches
cd ~/.hammerspoon
echo 'stackline = require "stackline.stackline.stackline"' >> init.lua
echo 'stackline:init()' >> init.lua
```

Now your `~/.hammerspoon` directory should look like this:


```
├── init.lua
└── stackline
  ├── bin
  │   └── yabai-get-stack-idx
  ├── conf.lua
  ├── stackline
  │   ├── configmanager.lua
  │   ├── query.lua
  │   ├── stack.lua
  │   ├── stackline.lua
  │   ├── stackmanager.lua
  │   └── window.lua
  └── lib
      └── …
```


#### 2. Install the hammerspoon cli tool

1. Ensure Hammerspoon is running
2. Open the hammerspoon console via the menu bar
3. Type `hs.ipc.cliInstall()` and hit return

<thead>
 <th>Open the Hammperspoon console via the menu bar</th>
 <th>Type `hs.ipc.cliInstall()` and hit return</th>

  <tr>
    <td>
       <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1683979/90970190-66513400-e4b6-11ea-9385-6e31571fd013.png"/>

    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Finally confirm that `hs` is now available by entering the following in your terminal (shell):

```sh
❯ which hs
/usr/local/bin/hs
```

### RETRO? GO! FIDO? GO! GUIDANCE…

We're almost there!

```sh
# Launch yabai (or make sure it's running)
brew services start yabai

# Launch hammerspoon (or make sure it's running)
open -a "Hammerspoon"
```

Now, assuming you've been issuing these commands from a terminal and _also_ have a browser window open  on the same space, make sure your terminal is positioned immediately to the _left_ of Safari and issue the following command (or use [keybindings](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/wiki/Install-dependencies)) to create a stack:

```sh
yabai -m window --stack next
```

Did the terminal window expand to cover the area previously occupied by Safari? Great! At this point, you should notice **two app icons at the top-left corner of your terminal window**, like this:

<img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1683979/90969027-53376780-e4a8-11ea-88c9-354f43b0a4ef.png" />

If the icons are a bit too heavy for you, you can toggle minimalist mode by turning the icons off:

```sh
hs -c 'stackline.config:toggle("appearance.showIcons")'
```

The minimalist stack indicator style is shown here ↑

See the wiki to [for details about how to do this with a key binding!](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/wiki/Keybindings).


## Help us get to v1.0.0!

Give a ⭐️ if you think (a more fully-featured version of) stackline would be useful!

## Thanks to contributors!

All are welcome (actually, _please_ help us, 🤣️)! Feel free to dive in by opening an [issue](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/issues/new) or submitting a PR.

[@alin23](https://github.com/alin23) initially proposed the [concept for stackline here](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/203#issuecomment-652948362) and encouraged [@AdamWagner](https://github.com/AdamWagner) to share the mostly-broken proof-of-concept publicly. Since then, [@alin23](https://github.com/alin23) dramatically improved upon the initial proof-of-concept with [#13](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/pull/13), has some pretty whiz-bang functionality on deck with [#17](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/pull/17), and has been a great thought partner/reviewer.  

[@zweck](https://github.com/zweck), who, [in the same thread](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/203#issuecomment-656780281), got the gears turning about how [@alin23](gh-alin23)'s idea could be implemented and _also_ urged Adam to share his POC.

[@johnallen3d](https://github.com/johnallen3d) for being one the first folks to install stackline, and for identifying several mistakes & gaps in the setup instructions. 

[@pete-may](https://github.com/pete-may) for saving folks from frustration by fixing an out-of-date command in the readme ([#48](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline/pull/48))

[@AdamWagner](https://github.com/AdamWagner) wrote the initial proof-of-concept (POC) for stackline.

### …on the shoulders of giants

Thanks to [@koekeishiya](gh-koekeishiya) without whom the _wonderful_ [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) would not exist, and projects like this would have no reason to exist.

Similarly, thanks to [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann), who has helped _so many people_ make chunkwm/yabai "do the thing" they want and provides great feedback on new and proposed yabai features.

Thanks to [@cmsj](https://github.com/cmsj), [@asmagill](https://github.com/asmagill), and all of the contributors to [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) for making macOS APIs accessible to the rest of us!

Thanks to the creators & maintainers of the lua utility libaries [underscore.lua](https://github.com/mirven/underscore.lua), [lume.lua](https://github.com/rxi/lume), and [self.lua](https://github.com/M1que4s/self).
